# GIMIC: gauge-including magnetically induced currents


## Documentation: http://gimic.readthedocs.io


## About GIMIC

The GIMIC program calculates magnetically induced currents in molecules. You
need to provide this program with a density matrix in atomic-orbital (AO) basis
and three (effective) magnetically perturbed AO density matrices in the proper
format.

Currently only recent versions of ACES2 and Turbomole can produce these
matrices, but Dalton is in the works. If you would like to add your favourite
program to the list please use the source, Luke.


## Example

There is an annotated example input in the examples/ directory.
