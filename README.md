# GIMIC: gauge-including magnetically induced currents

## Documentation

## About GIMIC

This is the GIMIC program for calculating magnetically induced currents in
molecules. For this program produce any kind of useful information, you
need to provide it with an AO density matrix and three (effective)
magnetically perturbed AO density matrices in the proper format. Currently
only recent versions of ACES2 and Turbomole can produce these matrices, but
Dalton is in the works. If you would like to add your favourite program to the
list please use the source, Luke.


## Example

There is an annotated example input in the examples/ directory.
