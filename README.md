# GIMIC: gauge-including magnetically induced currents


## Documentation: http://gimic.readthedocs.io


## About GIMIC

The GIMIC program calculates magnetically induced currents in molecules. You
need to provide this program with a density matrix in atomic-orbital (AO) basis
and three (effective) magnetically perturbed AO density matrices in the proper
format.

Currently ACES2, Turbomole, G09, QChem, FERMION++, and LSDalton can produce these
matrices.


## Example

There is an annotated example input in the examples/ directory.
